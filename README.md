## 📚 Credits

This project was inspired by the following tutorial:

- [**How to Build a Weather App with Python | Weather API**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWzHKfrvqw)  
  by **Arpan Neupane** on YouTube

The original concept and application structure are based on this tutorial, while the styling and interface design were mostly done by me.
